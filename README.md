## Wed 27/02/19 -  First Sprint Planning Meeting
Discussed our approach to tackling coursework using agile methods. Agreed to use SCRUM and simulate daily scrum meeting via online group video chat (9am every second day) - using apear.in

### High Level Planning:
- Decided to implement the MVC model and arranged a meeting to trail pair programming. 
- We agreed that the report will be written alongside the programming aspect. 

Following the review of the requirements and individually produced user stories, we completed the Product Backlog. From this we produced the Sprint Backlog for the first sprint (Product backlog, Sprint Backlog, Burndown Chart will be recorded using Trello) and agreed upon the following provisional  timescales 

- First sprint 27/02/19–09/03/19 (10  Days)
- Second sprint 09/03/19–19/03/19 (10 Days)
- Finalizing the report–19/03/19–21/03/19 (2 Days)

## Sat 01/03/19 – Tried out a pair/trio Coding Session:
Focus of session was to implement the basic threading requirements set out in the Sprint Backlog and begin to apply the MCV Design pattern to program from coursework one.  
Reviewed and restructured our current implementation, assigned classes to the relevant Model, View and Controller packages.   
Made good progress implementing the threading requirements but program was logical error requed a fix.
